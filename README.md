3. Connecting to the instance using ssh
```
ssh -i instance.pem ubunutu@<IP_ADDRESS>
```

### Configuring Ubuntu on remote VM

1. Updating the outdated packages and dependencies
```
sudo apt update
```
3. Install Git - [Guide by DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu-22-04) 
4. Configure Node.js and `npm` - [Guide by DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-22-04)

### Deploying the project on AWS

1. Clone this project in the remote VM
```
git clone https://github.com/vishu8844/MyFisrtCloudAppProject
```
2. Setup the following environment variables - `(.env)` file
```
DOMAIN= ""
PORT=3000
STATIC_DIR="./client"

PUBLISHABLE_KEY=""
SECRET_KEY=""
```
> For this project, we'll have to set up an [Elastic IP Address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) for our EC2 & that would be our `DOMAIN`

3. Initialise and start the project
```
npm install
npm run start
```

> NOTE - We will have to edit the **inbound rules** in the security group of our EC2, in order to allow traffic from our particular port
> Copy the Public IP:Port Number into the browser and the Application will be launched!!!
